# CSS :hover Pseudo-class Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue where the CSS `:hover` pseudo-class doesn't function correctly.  The problem involves a specific element that fails to update its styles when the mouse hovers over it.  This can stem from incorrect selectors, conflicting styles, or problems with event propagation.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a corrected version illustrating the fix.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Hover your mouse over the element that should change its style.  You will observe that no style changes occur.
4. Review `bug.css` to understand the problematic code.
5. Then refer to `bugSolution.css` for the solution.

## Possible Causes

* **Incorrect Selector:** The CSS selector might be targeting the wrong element.
* **Style Conflicts:** Another CSS rule might be overriding the `:hover` styles with higher specificity.
* **Event Propagation:** Parent elements might be capturing hover events, preventing the child element from receiving them.
